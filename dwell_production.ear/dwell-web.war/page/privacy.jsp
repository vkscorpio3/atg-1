		<div class="std">
			<p><strong></strong><br />By sharing the Dwell Life, Inc. (&ldquo;Dwell&rdquo;) Privacy Policy, we hope to help you understand how information can create new opportunities for our customers, as well as to reassure you that we respect and honor customer requests to restrict and protect personal information.</p>
			<p>By using dwell.com, store.dwell.com, or dwellondesign.com (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;), using our mobile apps, calling customer service, etc, interacting with us in any way, or utilizing our services, you consent to this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h2><strong>Getting to Know You</strong></h2>
			<h3>Personal Information:</h3>
			<p>When you make a purchase on our Website, create an account, join our registry or trade program, participate in a sweepstakes or contest or any other promotion, answer one of our surveys, or interact with us in any way, you may choose to give us personal information, such as: your name, email address, mailing address, ZIP code, phone number and credit card numbers. This allows us to provide you with our services, to process your transactions more efficiently and, ultimately, to give you a higher caliber of customer service. The decision to provide this information is optional. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of our Website or our services. Likewise, other companies also may forward to us additional names, mailing addresses and email addresses, as well as demographic and other usage information, when we have news or product offerings that may be of special interest to their customers. We also may receive personal information through the use of social media websites and services, or other sources.</p>
			<h3>Usage and Website Activity Information</h3>
			<p>When you visit our Website, we may collect more information: Your Internet service provider's address, the name of the website directing you, as well as your clicks and activity on our Website. This anonymous usage information generally is not associated with your personal information. This tracking data helps us understand how to make our Website more available and user-friendly to our customers.</p>
			<p>We also gather customer information by taking note of the purchases you make. Think of it as a concierge service where customer preferences are remembered for future consideration. By looking at your purchases in context with marketing demographics or with information from companies whose products and services you may be interested in, it helps us continue to seek out products or services you may find relevant and unique.</p>
			<h2>Cookies Are Served</h2>
			<p>"Cookies" are small amounts of data that are stored on your computer. They find their way to your browser via a Web server. Cookies flag information about your activity on our Website. This information helps us improve our Website and make them friendlier and easier to use. We never use cookies to save passwords, credit card numbers or other highly confidential information. However, we may use them to provide enhanced online marketing based on your interests and preferences.</p>
			<h2>Information at Your Service</h2>
			<p>The personal information we collect is primarily intended to offer better customer service and to improve communications. The customer information from our brands may be combined to provide greater security and inform customers of products and services that may interest them. When a purchased item is not immediately available, many of our customers appreciate receiving an email to update the status of their order. We also may need to contact customers by phone, postal mail or email if questions arise regarding their orders.</p>
			<h2>Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
			<p>In order to serve you better, we may at times contract with other companies (&ldquo;Service Providers&rdquo;) to help us process information. For instance, their assistance can help us better fulfill customer orders, manage, store and enhance customer data, and comply with postal regulations. For your security, these companies are bound by our nondisclosure agreements or other contractual arrangements to provide privacy protection for your information.</p>
			<p>We use a Service Provider to send emails. Web cookies are used in those email messages and at our Website to help us measure the effectiveness of those emails and for other analytical purposes. You can "opt out" of this email cookie at any time by deleting your name from our email mailing list, as detailed below.</p>
			<p>We also contract with a Service Provider to help us assess visitation to our Website. To do this, we place small pixel tags and cookies on our Website. While these do allow our Service Provider to track your visits, the data retrieved cannot be used for any reason without our authorization. Although our Service Provider logs the information about your visit, we control how that data may and may not be used.</p>
			<p>We contract with Service Providers to place our banner advertising on other websites. These Service Providers may collect information from us about your visits to our Website, and your interaction with our products and services. They also may use this information to tailor banner advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information may be shared with our Service Provider and its service providers, including your name, postal address and email address, as well as a record of any transactions you conduct on our Website or offline in order to deliver banner advertisements and other advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain websites. Our trusted Service Provider will keep this data anonymous and will not share any personally identifiable information with any other third parties.</p>

			<h2>Protecting Children's Privacy</h2>
			<p>Dwell adheres to a strict privacy code regarding children and does not knowingly accept personal information from any child under the age of 13. If it is brought to our attention that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under 13, we will immediately remove all personal and identifiable information from our records in compliance with the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. In addition, we will not disclose this information to any other companies.</p>
			<h2>Be Careful When You Share Information with Others</h2>
			<p>Please be aware that whenever you share information on a publicly available area of our Website, such as an area allowing for customer comments, that information may be accessed by others. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.</p>
			<h2>Links to Sites And Services</h2>
			<p>At times, we provide links our customers may be interested in, including links to social media sites such as Facebook. Dwell is not responsible for these websites, which have their own privacy policies and privacy practices to which you may be subject. When visiting our presence on social media or other tools, you will be subject to those websites&rsquo; privacy policies. If you visit our Website through a link from another website, you may be subject to that website&rsquo;s privacy policy as well. If you choose to explore these other websites and services, we suggest that you carefully review their individual privacy policies. See our Terms of Use for further information about use of social media.</p>
			<h2>Compliance With Laws and Law Enforcement</h2>
			<p>Dwell cooperates with government and law-enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose personal information and any other information about you to government or law-enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas); to protect the safety, property or rights of Dwell Life, Inc. or of any third party; to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity; or to comply with the law.</p>
			<h2>Information Security</h2>
			<p>We take our customers&rsquo; personal information seriously and take steps to protect our customers' personal information against loss, misuse, alteration and unauthorized access. We use encryption technology whenever receiving and transferring your payment information on our Website.</p>
			<h2><br />About SSL Certificates</h2>
			<p>When you make a purchase online, a paypal security seal will appear in the lower right of your browser window or in front of the website URL. This icon indicates that your transaction session is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If one of these icons does not appear, please contact the Dwell Store at customerservice@dwell.com to complete your purchase.</p>
			<h2>Processing in the United States</h2>
			<p>Please be aware that your personal information and communications may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province or country. If you are located outside the United States, please be advised that we process and store all information in the United States. The laws in the United States may not be as protective of your privacy as those in your location. By using our Website or our services, you agree that the collection, use, transfer and disclosure of your personal information and communications will be governed by the applicable laws in the United States.</p>
			<h2>Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
			<p>Efforts to bring new services, ideas and partners to benefit our customers may make it necessary to amend our Privacy Policy. If this occurs, we will post the new policy on our Website. Once posted, the new policy will go into effect immediately, replacing any previously stated policy. Your continued use of our Website or services constitutes your consent to the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
